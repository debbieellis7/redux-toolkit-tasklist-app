# **Task Management App**

A simple and efficient task management application built with **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Redux Toolkit**. This project serves as a demonstration of my expertise in these technologies, particularly in state management with Redux Toolkit, while showcasing clean and scalable code practices.

## **Features**
- **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks**: Users can create, update, and remove tasks with titles, descriptions, and statuses.
- **Task Status Filtering**: Filter tasks by their status (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Completed").
- **Redux Toolkit for State Management**: All task-related actions (add, edit, delete, filter) are managed through Redux Toolkit's slice and reducer pattern.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Initial tasks are fetched from an external API using `createAsyncThunk`.
- **Memoized Selectors**: Efficient state selection and filtering with memoized selectors (`createSelector`).
- **Responsive UI**: The user interface is built with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and responsive experience.

## **Technologies Used**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **React**: Component-based UI library
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management, including slices, async actions, and selectors
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive layout
- **Prettier**: For consistent code formatting
